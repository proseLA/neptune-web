Neptune is the Design System built by and used at Wise. Neptune Web is the Neptune framework for Web. Neptune Web provides a way to build high quality, consistent user experiences on the web with ease.

This is the Wise Web Dynamic flows React component library. It uses [Neptune CSS](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune-web/tree/main/packages/css).

## Usage

### TypeScript | Type Declarations

This package exposes [type declarations](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/type-declarations.html) for all components.

Note: types for some of components are not 100% accurate (some of them will be just [`any`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#any)), this is due to fact that many of components written on JavaScript and types generated by [react-to-typescript-definitions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-to-typescript-definitions) based of components `PropTypes` and unfortunatly the library doesn't resolve all `PropTypes` features and use cases (e.g custom validators, `PropTypes.objectOf`, [requireIf](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-required-if), etc). But bear with us as eventually it would be fully on TypeScript.

Please follow [rules for JS components](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune-web/blob/main/packages/components/CONTRIBUTING.md#js-component-rules) in order to generate accurate types for them.
