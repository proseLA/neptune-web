Size tokens as custom properties for you to use in your application.

**Note:** If this is your first time using custom properties in your application, read <DocumentLink href="/about/Styles#tokens-css-custom-properties">our guide</DocumentLink> first to get set up.

On our components and layouts we use a fixed list of values to define lengths. This helps maintain rhythm and ensures consistent alignment across our products.

In Neptune we use a 4-point scale that gives finer control to align elements inside components and optimise space on smaller screens, and from 16 onwards it becomes an 8-point scale where the difference in steps is more visible.

## Sizes
