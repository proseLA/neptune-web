Neptune-css and Neptune-components are ready to use in RTL (Right to Left) direction languages. 

## The basics

Get <code>dir</code> attribute in HTML element depending the language.

LTR laguages:
```
<html dir="ltr" >
```

RTL laguages:
```
<html dir="rtl" >
```

- <code>dir</code> attribute has implicit the direction CSS property natively, so using the attribute is enough to make the layout switch.
- Default alignment, tables, flex and grid elements work really nice with the direction property and the browser creates natively the expected layout, except when the code uses a "left" or a "right" value.
- W3C specification is working on [logical properties and values](https://drafts.csswg.org/css-logical/) to solve the horizontal physical direction but the support is being uneven yet.
- To solve the horizontal properties and values we are going to use the RTL mixin. Neptune code is prepared with the RTL mixin already, but you may add it to your custom CSS in your project, to have the total experience.

## The RTL mixin
There is Less [a mixin](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune-web/blob/rtl-with-css-logical-properties/packages/css/src/less/mixins/_logical-properties-IE-friendly.less) to control the direction of the physical horizontal properties and values in Neptune. With this mixin we are going to be able to control and scale the support in browsers of logical properties. Right now itâ€™s prepared to output the IE11 friendly version.

### Usage

Add the import reference at the top of the .less file:

```
@import (reference)
  "@transferwise/neptune-css/src/less/mixins/_logical-properties.less";
```

Update all the horizontal properties (left, right) with a mixin call in your custom .less file:

ðŸ’¡ Tip: If left and right values are equal in the same selector we can keep them as they are without having to update to the mixin syntax. 
Keep the code as it is when:
```
padding-left: var(--foo1);
padding-right: var(--foo1);
```
```
padding: 0 var(--foo);
```
```
padding: 0 var(--foo) 0;
```

### New syntax:

#### Spacing:

```
margin-left: var(--foo); â†’ .margin(left, var(--foo));
```
There is a second optional value for the mixin `.margin(direction, value1, value2)`, if you need to specify/reset the oposite direction value.

By instance, let's imagin that we have a `margin-left: 8px`. The mixin for it would be `.margin(left, 8px)` and on RTL cases would be transformed to `margin-right: 8px`.
By default, it also maintains the property `margin-left`, because the mixin doesn't have the information of its value. We may want to reset it to `0` or add another value depending the case. We have this `value2` option to do that.

This is because we want to keep the default property with not conditional selectors which could add specificity value to the property and create collateral cascale collisions.


```
padding-left: var(--foo); â†’ .padding(left, var(--foo));
```
Same as in magin cases, in padding also we do have this second value to reset the default direction if needed `.padding(direction, value1, value2)`

Shorthands (only when left != right or you need more specificity):
```
margin: 0 0 0 var(--foo); â†’ .margin-shorthand(0, 0, 0, var(--foo));
```
```
padding: 0 0 0 var(--foo); â†’ .padding-shorthand(0, 0, 0, var(--foo));
```

#### Alignment:

```
text-align: left; â†’ .text-align(left);
```

#### Positions: 

```
left: var(foo);. â†’ .left(var(--foo));
```

#### Floats:

```
float: left;. â†’ .float(left);
```

#### Clear:

```
clear: left â†’ .clear(left);
```

#### Border: 

```
border-left: 1px solid pink; â†’ .border(left, 1px, solid, pink);
```
```
border-left-width: 1px; â†’ .border-width(left, 1px);
```
```
border-top-left-radius: 3px; â†’ .border-top-dir-radius(left, 3px);
```
```
border-bottom-left-radius: 3px; â†’ .border-bottom-dir-radius(left, 3px);
```
```
border-bottom-left-radius: 3px;
border-top-left-radius: 3px; (both top and bottom) â†’ .border-radius(left, 3px); 
```

#### Background position: 

```
background-position: left; â†’  .background-position(left);
```
```
background-position: left bottom; â†’  .background-position(left, bottom);
```

#### Background linear gradient: 

```
background: linear-gradient(to left, var(--color1) var(--color2)) â†’ .background-linear-gradient(left, var(--color1), var(--color2));
```
